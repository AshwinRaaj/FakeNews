# TruthLens:AI Powered Fake News Detection
## About:
The proliferation of information on the internet has led to an increase in the circulation of both authentic and fake news. Fake news can mislead readers, manipulate opinions, and cause societal harm. Identifying fake news can be a challenging task, especially for users who are not trained in media literacy. The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify news articles into "real" or "fake" categories, improving the efficiency and accuracy of news verification.

The project focuses on developing a machine learning model that can process and analyze textual content from news articles, extract meaningful patterns, and use them to distinguish between real and fake news. By using state-of-the-art NLP techniques such as text pre-processing, tokenization, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms, we aim to create an efficient fake news detection system.

## Features:
News Data Collection: The model will be trained on labeled datasets containing both real and fake news articles from multiple sources.

Text Pre-processing: The project uses NLP techniques like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and text normalization to clean and prepare the dataset.

Feature Extraction: The system will extract relevant features from the articles, such as bag-of-words, n-grams, sentiment analysis, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Model Training: The model will be trained using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, among others.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Real-Time Classification: Once the model is trained, it will be able to classify new, unseen news articles as real or fake in real-time.

Visualization: Data visualization will be used to represent the distribution of real vs fake news and evaluate model performance through graphs and charts.

## Requirements:
### Software Requirements:
Python 3.x
### Libraries:
pandas (for data manipulation)

numpy (for numerical computations)

scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)

nltk/spacy (for NLP tasks)

matplotlib & seaborn (for visualization)

TensorFlow or PyTorch (optional, if using deep learning models)

regex (for text cleaning and processing)

### Hardware Requirements:
A machine with at least 8 GB RAM and 4 CPU cores for smooth processing.

A stable internet connection to gather datasets from online sources if necessary.

## System Architecture:

## Results:
The results of the fake news classification model will be evaluated based on several metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.

Precision: The fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances (i.e., the percentage of correctly predicted fake news articles).

Recall: The fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved (i.e., the modelâ€™s ability to detect all fake news articles).

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Confusion Matrix: A table used to describe the performance of the classification model in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Impact:
Combating Misinformation: By using this model, users can quickly detect fake news and prevent the spread of misinformation.

Promoting Trust: The model can help restore trust in online news platforms by providing users with a way to easily verify the authenticity of news articles.

Boosting Media Literacy: This tool can also serve as an educational platform, helping users understand the markers of fake news and improving media literacy.

Efficiency: Automating the process of fake news detection saves time and effort compared to manual verification.

Scalability: The model can be scaled to analyze massive datasets and could be deployed in real-time applications such as social media platforms, news websites, or browser extensions.
